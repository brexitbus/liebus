			<p>Everybody is doing it, you know the one, great big lies on the side of a bus. Well <b>some</b> more than others üôÑ</p>

			<p>This site simply provides a blank canvas, it's up to you the public if you want to mock, spread the truth or continue to lie through your booze stained teeth</p>

			<p>Some top subjects to lie about are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Where you are reciving funding from</li>
				<li>How easy this brexit lark will be</li>
				<li>Making your own personal gains (Sorry i mean taking back are cuntry)</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>Voting Against Brexit</h3>
				<p>Contrary to another of the relentless lies that European members of parliament are "unelected elite" here is a list of parties and MEPs who back staying in the European Union, these positions certainly arent unelected.</p>
				<p>By voting <b>on the 23rd of May</b> for these parties you help show that common sense is in fact still common place in Great Britain.</p>

				<p>After all this may be the last time you can vote for an MEP and you lose your democratic right to a say in the european union.</p>

				<div class="parties">
					<div class="party party--change">
						<div class="title">Change UK</div>

						<p>The break away group from the leading and opposition parties Tory and Labour who were unhappy with how brexit is being handled. Change UK aim to oust Brexit and change UK politics for a more democratic / less paid for by lobbyists in other countries kind of politics</p>
					</div>

					<div class="party party--green">
						<div class="title">Green Party</div>

						<p>Green party are the hippies of the group, whilst never being a serious contender in mainstream politics, they know brexit is a bad idea</p>
					</div>

					<div class="party party--lib">
						<div class="title">Liberal Democrats</div>

						<p>After commiting political suicide a couple of general elections back they've been taking it easy in the wings just waiting to pounce on a royal fuck up by the main parties and this is exactly what has happened in the local elections just passed. Gaining a massive upsurgence of local seats means the liberal democrats may be back in business, and they are ready to oust this brexit nonsense</p>
					</div>

					<div class="party party--plaid">
						<div class="title">Plaid Cymru</div>

						<p>The Welsh party, pushing for Wales to have more say in the UK and with it quash brexit. Could be an interesting outcome as whilst wales as a whole voted in minor majority to leave, reports are saying it was heavily targeted by rogue leave advertising and propaganda which accounted for whole small towns literally believing that their own town had the highest number of immigrants in the whole of the UK when statistically that was quite the opposite. Lets see if peoples eyes are a bit more open this time round</p>
					</div>

					<div class="party party--snp">
						<div class="title">SNP</div>

						<p>Scotland, need we say more, land of the free, home of the brave. They've done this "independence" vote thing before, they've had their eyes opened up to the lies from all sides and like the who, they wont get fooled again. SNP are anti-brexit and want scotland and the UK as a whole to be in the EU more than ever. </p>
